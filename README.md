## Double-Click to Reset:
- Double-click anywhere on the canvas to clear all the elements.

# Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.
## One of the following methods:
- I choose to drive your individual code: User Input:Incorporate mouse or keyboard inputs for animation.
 
## Reveals only some components at a time:
- After double-clicking, rectangles will reappear first, followed by semi-circles, and finally circles.

## Gradual Appearance Animation
- GIF Reference: Loading animations where elements appear one after another, such as a series of dots or shapes gradually coming into view.
